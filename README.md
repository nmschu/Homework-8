# Homework-8

===============================================================

CIS 411, homework 8 had us create an MVC 4 app. We needed to make it a pet store.

The pet store had a homepage where there was a picture and some absic information about the store.

There is an inventory page where guests can see what animals are in stock, then a button to click to view more details.

A manage page where an admin can log in and add a pet to the inventory, edit the current breed of pet, or delete some from the list.

After it was created, we linked Azure to GitHub in order to have continuous integration... everytime it is updated in GitHub, it updates in Azure and immediately redeploys.
